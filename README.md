# Video Game Sales
Data taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales?resource=download

This data contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies sold. The number of sales are calculated in millions. Publishing dates go from 1989-2020. The data set consists of a mix of strings and floats. Less than 3% of the data set contains null values, it is mainly seen in the 'Year' and 'Publisher' columns. The data set has already been ranked based off of sales and is in descending order. There are over 16,500 games listed in this dataset.

Assumptions consist of viewing the data set as a list of video games sold based off physical copies only. This will not include data of any downloadable version of these games. The focus, in terms of sales, will be averaged from the Global_Sales column. This gives you a general idea of worldwide sales which can easily be broken down and investigated further if analysis requires it.
